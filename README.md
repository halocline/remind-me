# remind-me
For all those infrequent but important tasks you want to keep up with (e.g. like fertilizing your lawn, watering your succulents, changing your water filter, and more).

## ToDos
- Features
  - Should allow me to specify a task
  - Should allow me to set a frequency in which the task needs to be done
  - Should allow me to assign an individual whom is responsible for completing the task
  - Should allow me to add reminder notifications
  - Should allow notifications to be published to (subscribed by?) various apps and devices (e.g. Google Home issues reminder "Good morning, Matt. It's been 30 days since you last fertilized your lawn. Time to re-apply. Have you done this yet? No. Do you have fertilizer on hand? No. Would you like me to order some for delivery? Yes. Last time you used x-brand summer blend. Is that what you still want? No. Which type would you like instead?).
